dotfiles
========

My home configuration files for linux.

Run `./setup.sh -f -p` to make symlinks in home to dotfiles.
`-f` to overwrite existing files in home. `-p` to also install vim plugins.

Secret files/dirs like `.ssh` are not in this repo since it's public on github.

If you fork this repo, you'll probably want to change the `name` and `email`
entries in `gitconfig`.
