dotfiles
========

My home configuration files for linux.

To use these on windows, checkout the `windows` branch.

Run `./setup.sh` to make symlinks from home to each dotfile.
**Warning:** any existing home dotfiles will be overwritten.

Secret files/dirs like `.ssh` are not in this repo since it's public on github.

If you fork this repo, you'll probably want to change the `name` and `email`
entries in `gitconfig`.
